Code to calculate mitochondrial enrichment factor from the proteome of mammals

# Description
This code was created to help filter out mitochondrial proteins from a whole lysate proteome (i.e. cells, tissues, explants) of mammals generally used in research (i.e. mouse, rat, human). Once the dataset is uploaded, we use MitoCarta 3.0 library to select mitochondrial protein. After that, the sum of intensities obtained from MS is calculated from both datasets and the mitochondrial enrichment factor is calculated and exported.
